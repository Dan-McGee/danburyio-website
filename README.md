newhaven.io
===========

This is the code for the [newhaven.io](http://www.newhaven.io) website.  
It's just a placeholder right now. If you'd like to help build the
site (and the New Haven hacker community) please get in touch.  You can
find fellow New Haven hackers via

* the [newhaven.io Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/newhavenio);
* the [newhaven.io Twitter account](http://twitter.com/newhavenio)
* the #newhavenio IRC channel on Freenode.

## TODO

* create small, simple logo for favicon ala twitter

## Requirements

The newhavenio.io website is statically generated and hosted on AWS's S3
service.  To make changes to the website, you'll need a few
[Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) tools in your environment.  The following
instructions will help you install those tools.  (These instructions are
a tad pedantic for the benefit of those who would like to contribute
but perhaps have less development experience.)

### Setting up your Ruby environment

    bundle # this should get the right gems setup
...todo.  Deps are in the `.rvmrc` file.

## About thew newhaven.io site

newhaven.io is powered in part by [Gumby 2](http://gumbyframework.com/), a
front-end toolkit created by New Haven's own
[Digital Surgeons](http://www.digitalsurgeons.com/).  The design
was created by [Adam Soffer](http://github.com/ads1018).

Gumby 2 uses Sass and Compass which you'll need to install to get your environment
set up correctly.  (See the section above on setting up your environment.)
Gumby 2 has a nice set of docs you can check out [here](http://gumbyframework.com/docs/sass/).

## Running locally

[Usage Â· mojombo/jekyll Wiki](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/usage#running-jekyll)

    jekyll --server
    open localhost:4000

## Building and deploying

To build the .css assets, run

    compass compile

To deploy the site you'll need [s3cmd](http://s3tools.org/s3cmd), which you can install
via homebrew, e.g.

    brew install s3cmd

or, via bundle/gem.  You'll also need a `.s3cfg` file containing at least
the following lines

    [default]
    access_key=YOUR-ACCESS-KEY-GOES-HERE-YO
    secret_key=YOUR-SECRET-KEY-GOES-HERE-YO

You can get deployment keys from Kyle.  To run a deployment, do 

    sh ./deploy.sh

## Creating a new event

To make a new event, add a file to the `events/_posts` directory.
The file name should start with a date and end with `md`,
e.g. `2013-03-04-my-event.md`.  The file's content should look
something like the following:

    ---
    layout: event
    title: March NewHaven.rb Social
    location: Christies
    time: 6:00 PM
    address: 261 Orange St, New Haven, CT
    host: NewHaven.rb
    host_twitter: newhavenrb
    ---
    Get some drinks & dinner in New Haven, and talk about your
    start-up, your open source project, or whatever. It's easy.
    You can
    [RSVP](http://www.meetup.com/newhavenrb/events/106769762/)
    on Meetup.com.

The top-matter is in [Yaml](http://www.yaml.org/) format and the
"content" is in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
format.  These fields are used to render information about the event
on the newhaven.io website.
