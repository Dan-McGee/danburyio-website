# Newhaven.io

Notes on setup. I use Ubuntu 12.04 for my dev machine.

## Server Setup (Ubuntu)

### Basics

	$ sudo apt-get update
	$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
	$ sudo apt-get install python-software-properties
	$ sudo apt-get install wget curl vim git-core

### Install pre-0.10.0 node & npm:

	$ sudo apt-get install build-essential
	$ wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.9.9/node-v0.9.9.tar.gz
	$ tar -xvf node-v0.9.9.tar.gz
	$ cd node-v0.9.9
	$ ./configure
	$ make	# Get some coffee
	$ sudo make install

### Basic app setup

	$ git clone git@github.com:newhavenio/newhavenio-website.git
	$ cd newhavenio-website
	$ vim package.json
	> "version": "0.1.0"  # from "version": "0.0.0"
	> "node": ">=0.8.0 <0.10.*"     # from "node": ">=0.8.0"
	$ sudo npm install -g express    # Install globally
	$ express --sessions --ejs   # Create express in local directory
	$ npm install  # Get dependencies
	$ node app     # Express server listening on port 3000

### Dev Dependencies

    $ sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
    $ sudo npm install -g bower

On a headless virtual machine, you can get grunt-server working with the `--force` flag to keep it working despite live-reload not having a browser to open:

    $ grunt server --force

Finally, there is both bower and npm package managers in play. Make sure all local dependencies are installed:

    $ npm install
    $ bower install

## Server Setup (Mac)

I believe you can follow the
[installation instructions](https://github.com/newhavenio/newhavenio-website/blob/master/README.md) for the static nhv.io
website.  Then, do this additional step to ensure
express is installed globally.

	npm install express

(We should probably be installing Bower globally too.)

### Application architecture

Here's where stuff lives
* `app` = the client side application
* `dist` = where the compiled, minified client side assets are put
* `server` = the server side appliction
* `test` = tests, both server and client, of which, few

The client side is an [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/) application
that talks to an [Express](http://expressjs.com/) application on 
the server.  The server
* serves all the static content;
* has a RESTful API for managing users and companies; and
* uses GitHub for authentication via OAuth.

The client 
* is defined in the static js & html content returned by the server;
* loads a bunch of stuff dynamically, including
  * Meetup.com events, via JSONP; and,
  * Users (developers) and companies via our server's RESTful API.
* allows CRUD on users and companies using [Restangular](https://github.com/mgonto/restangular), which is a nice way to interact with RESTful APIs from Angular applications.


### Github oAuth

`GET /auth`  - Will redirect you to Github for auth and redirect you to:
`GET /auth/callback` - Which will then redirect you to GET /

When you load up the index page, and you're not logged in, there is
a "login with github" button at the bottom.  After you've logged
in, there is an "edit profile" button, which takes you to a URL that
looks like `http://localhost:9000/#/developers/5267ec3d505715ec75000001/edit`
where the weird string of numbers is the primary key in your mongodb
database for that user.  That controller uses Restangular to speak
to the backend and alter user data.  The user list view is at
`http://localhost:9000/#/developers`.

(The server is using in-memory sessions storage, which is fast, but
of course we lose them every time the server is restarted.)

### Mongodb

We're using [Mongodb](http://www.mongodb.org/) for the datastore and
the office node ORM: [Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/).  The development
environment requires you to start an instance of Mongodb locally to which
you have write access.  (See "Environment variables", below).

### Environment variables

There are a handful of variables declared in the `env` section of
`Gruntfile.js`. However, most environment variables should be stored
in your `.env` file so that you can run `grunt` commands using 
[foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman)
(or honcho or any other foreman clone).  My `.env` has the following
variables.

	AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=...
	AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=...
	GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=...
	GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=...
	GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL=...
	MONGOHQ_URL=...
	COOKIE_SECRET=...

#### Dev Notes

* Auth - Allow anyone to auth and add company? (Users separate from companies, separate from future user profiles?)
* Filter for authenticated actions (api requests need authentication)
* API - handle CRUD of business entries
* Design - Need Login with Github button or other call to action to add business to site
